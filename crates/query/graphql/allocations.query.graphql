# AllocationsQuery
#
# This query retrieves allocations for a specified indexer in The Graph's Indexer TAP system.
#
# Input Variables:
# - $indexer (ID!): The unique identifier of the Indexer whose allocations are being queried.
# - $closedAtThreshold (Int!): The threshold timestamp used to filter closed allocations.
# - $block (Block_height): The block height at which to query allocations (optional).
# - $first (Int!): The maximum number of allocations to return (used for pagination).
# - $last (ID!): The ID of the last allocation from a previous query (used for pagination).
#
# Query Logic:
# - Fetches block metadata (number, hash, timestamp) using the provided `$block` height.
# - Retrieves allocations filtered by:
#   - Allocations with `id > $last` (for pagination).
#   - Allocations where the indexer has the provided `$indexer` ID.
#   - Allocations that are either `Active`, or `Closed` but closed after `$closedAtThreshold`.
# - Results are sorted by `id` in ascending order and limited to `$first` number of entries.
#
# Fragment: AllocationFragment
# - Returns detailed information about each allocation, including:
#   - Allocation ID.
#   - Indexer ID.
#   - Number of allocated tokens.
#   - Block and epoch when the allocation was created.
#   - Epoch when the allocation was closed.
#   - Subgraph deployment ID and denial status.
#
# Example Use Case:
# This query helps Indexers monitor their allocations, filter out inactive or irrelevant allocations,
# and retrieve allocation data for specific block heights or timeframes.
