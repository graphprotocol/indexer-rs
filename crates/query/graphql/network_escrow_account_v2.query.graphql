# Network Subgraph EscrowAccount Query V2
# 
# This query retrieves V2 escrow account information from the network subgraph,
# which tracks PaymentsEscrow and GraphTallyCollector contract events.
#
# Input Variables:
# - $receiver (Bytes!): The address of the Indexer whose escrow accounts are being queried.
# - $thawEndTimestamp (BigInt!): A timestamp used to filter signers whose thaw period has ended or is about to end.
#
# Query Logic:
# - Fetches escrow accounts where the `receiver` is the provided indexer address.
# - Returns the following information for each escrow account:
#   - `balance`: The current balance of the escrow account.
#   - `totalAmountThawing`: The total amount currently thawing in the escrow.
# - Retrieves the payer and filters the payer's `signers` based on:
#   - `thawEndTimestamp_lte`: Only includes signers whose thaw end timestamp is less than or equal to the provided $thawEndTimestamp.
#   - `isAuthorized: true`: Only includes signers that are authorized.
