//! # tracker
//!
//! This is the heart of tap-agent, every decision depends on these trackers.
//!
//! There are two main trackers: [SimpleFeeTracker] [SenderFeeTracker].
//! Each of them enable certain methods that allows fine-grained control over what are the
//! algorithm that selects the biggest allocation.
//!
//! The tracker contains a tricky feature called buffer that is used to count know the counter of
//! any key in X amount of seconds ago. This is important since, receipt timestamp_ns is provided
//! by senders, we want to have a tolerance buffer where we still accept receipts with timestamp
//! older than our current clock.
